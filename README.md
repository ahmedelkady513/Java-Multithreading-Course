# Java Multithreading & Concurrency Skills

I have successfully completed the [Java Multithreading, Concurrency & Performance Optimization course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-multithreading-concurrency-performance-optimization/learn/lecture/11956100#overview), where I deepened my understanding and skills in Java's multithreading and concurrency capabilities. This course has equipped me with practical knowledge and best practices in several key areas:

## What I Learned

### Thread Fundamentals
- Understanding the basics of threads in Java, including how to create, run, and manage threads effectively.

### Performance Optimization
- Techniques for optimizing Java applications for better performance, focusing on multithreaded performance enhancement.

### Data Sharing Between Threads
- Strategies for safely sharing data between threads, ensuring data consistency and integrity without sacrificing performance.

### Inter-Thread Communications
- Methods for enabling smooth and efficient communication between threads using wait/notify mechanisms and other approaches.

### Data Races and Deadlocks
- Identifying and resolving common concurrency issues such as data races and deadlocks, ensuring reliable application behavior.

### Locks and Semaphores
- Utilizing synchronization mechanisms like locks and semaphores to control access to shared resources among multiple threads.

### Lock-Free Algorithms and Data Structures
- Implementing advanced lock-free algorithms and data structures to improve scalability and performance in concurrent applications.

### Java 21 Virtual Threads 
- An introduction to the virtual threads feature in Java 21, aimed at simplifying concurrent programming in Java.
